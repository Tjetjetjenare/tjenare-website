            "Tjenare is a Swedish greeting, similar to Hi or Hello. <b>Tjetjetjenare</b>, which is a jokingly extravagant way to say it, is an alias I've used extensively online for well over a decade.",

            "One part contains my WHOOP-data and is most of my training sessions leading up to me completing an Ironman in August of 2022. The other part contains training data from my COROS watch, which I started using in 2023. This data will be updated continuously.",
            "The <b>chrochet</b> section is a collection of my crochet projects, which I have been working on since late January of 2025.",
            "The <b>drawing</b> section is a collection of my drawings. I am a big fan of symmetry and patterns, and I have been drawing these patterns since I was 14 years old.",
            "The <b>baking</b> section is a collection of my favorite recipes, which I have gathered over the years.",
            "The last page is dedicated to movies. I am an avid movie fan, but I have a habit of rewatvhing movies I know I like instead of watching new ones. So for fun, I wanted to create a randomizer that picks a movie for me to watch. These movies are all from my watchlist on IMDb.",
